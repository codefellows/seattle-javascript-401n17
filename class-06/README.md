# HTTP and REST

Using REST (Representational State Transfer) over HTTP allows us to easily (and more importantly - reliably) perform CRUD Operations using a client library such as `fetch`, `superagent`, `axios` or even your browser. REST is a common architectural pattern that is widely adopted and used as a standard means of accessing and manipulating data over the internet.
