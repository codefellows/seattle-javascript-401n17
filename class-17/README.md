# TCP Server

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is widely used by application layer protocols in the Internet Protocol Suite. TCP creates a two way communication between two hosts and provides reliable, ordered, and error checked byte streams between the applications.

In this class, we will be building a multiple-server event driven system, using TCP as our communication layer.
