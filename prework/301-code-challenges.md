# 301 Code Challenges

It is recommended that you read the README, review the DEMO and watch the Videos provided for each of these challenges.

## Submitting This Assignment

- If you do not already have a `data-structures-and-algorithms` repo from 301 ...
  - Create a new repository on GitHub called `data-structures-and-algorithms`
  - Clone this to your computer, under your `codefellows` working folder
  - Copy the package.json file from the configs folder of this repository into your `data-structures-and-algorithms` folder
  - Run `npm install` from within that folder to install all of the dependencies.
  - Create a new folder within this repo called `code-challenges` and one called `301` within that
  - Turn on the "NodeJS" GitHub Actions workflow
- For each of the challenges below, create a new folder bearing the name of the challenge (i.e. `array-foreach`)
  - Write your code for each challenge in a file called `[challenge].test.js` in each folder (where [challenge] is the name of the challenge)
  - Ensure that running `npm test` from the main `data-structures-and-algorithms` folder  passes for all tests
  - Provide a link to the master branch of this repo in canvas
